<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 30px; margin-bottom: 25px;">Mini donuts were created as a smaller and more convenient version of the traditional donut. They first became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, especially at fairs, carnivals, and amusement parks in the United States. These tiny treats were made using a mini donut machine, which could quickly fry several donuts at once, making them fresh and hot for customers. Their small size made them easier to eat on the go and allowed people to enjoy more flavors in one serving. Over time, mini donuts spread to many countries and became a favorite snack in bakeries and food stalls. Today, they are not only enjoyed as a fun treat but also as a popular small business idea because they are affordable, eye-catching, and loved by both kids and adults.
